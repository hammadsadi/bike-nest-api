## :bike: BikeNest - Bike Servicing Management API Summary

The BikeNest Servicing Management System is a RESTful backend API designed to help bike servicing centers efficiently manage their operations. It enables easy handling of customer data, bike information, and service records through structured and scalable endpoints.

This system supports full CRUD operations for customers, bikes, and services, along with special endpoints to assign new service jobs and mark services as completed. For example, a specific endpoint allows setting a service's status to "done" and optionally includes a custom completionDate.

The backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma ORM, and uses PostgreSQL as the database. The codebase follows a modular and scalable architecture, making it easy to integrate features like authentication, invoicing, and notifications in the future.
